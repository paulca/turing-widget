# Turing Widget

A set of examples and a webpack setup for building a third-party embedded widget.

## Try me!

This app consumes the API provided by [Turing Form](https://github.com/paulca/turing-form), so be sure
to have that running first if you're testing locally.

Youâ€™ll need nodejs and npm installed.

Clone the repo then run `npm install`

## Run the local dev server

```
$ npm run serve
```
